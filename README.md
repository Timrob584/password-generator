# Password Generator
This is a password-generator based on user input.

## Motivation
For this password generator, I wanted the user to be able to input the details about the type of password they wanted to be generated. I wanted the to be able to choose the length of the password, whether to include Upper and Lowercase characters, whether to include numbers, and whether to include special characters.

#How to Use
1. Go to the link https://timrob584.github.io/password-generator/
2. When prompted the desired length of the password, enter a number between 8-128
3. When prompted if you want lowercase letters to be included, hit okay for yes and cancel for no.
4. When prompted if you want uppercase letters to be included, hit okay for yes and cancel for no.
5. When prompted if you want numbers to be included, hit okay for yes and cancel for no.
6. When prompted if you want special characters to be included, hit okay for yes and cancel for no.
7. The site will then generate a pawword to your specification.
